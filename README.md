<h3>What did you learn during this project?</h3>
<p>Plenty of things! Mainly getting to know HTML and CSS, how to plan and design a website/portfolio in Figma design.</p>

<h3>What was your biggest challenge, and how did you approach it?</h3>
<p>Since my plan for this project was to make an portfolio for my artpractice, something that has been on my todo for a while, 
I had high hopes that this project would turn out perfect. So finding the balance between timemanaging and ambition was key. And while I am happy how it turned out Im also excited of 
all the new ideas I found along the way that I cant wait to implement.</p>

<h3>If you were ever stuck while working on your project, how did you get unstuck? How did you find a way to move forward?</h3>
<p>Learning from my classmates and asking for help was an important lesson. Sometimes just airing the problem out loud would be enough for finding a solution. 
Also knowing where to look for answers have been helpful, like W3Schools,Youtube, Mozilla or Ai. </p>

<h3>What are you most proud of in your site?</h3>
<p>Creating a working portfolio and everything I learned along the way.</p>
